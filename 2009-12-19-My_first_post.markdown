Hello folks!

This is my first post on my blog. I'm just gonna do some testing...

There goes some code...

{% highlight ruby %}
def say_hi name
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello world!\n";
}
{% endhighlight %}

	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get upgrade

I like that:)

There's a link:

Ok, that's it for now. See you soon!
