My name is Tomasz Pewi≈Ñski and i'm a student of second grade of High School. I'm interested in computer programming, especially in languages like C++ and Ruby. My biggest project so far is [dicto][1] - "a tool to help you learn vocabulary". I am an open-source passionate and Linux fan. To see all my projects visit [projects][2].

On my [blog][3] I'll be publishing some interesting informations, usually related to programming, or useful tips for getting things done. Pop over at any time to see what I'm doing.

To contact me, please use my email - [pewniak747@gmail.com][4]. Follow me on [Twitter][5] or [GitHub][6].
